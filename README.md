# PJON-gRPC
PJON-gRPC is a server-client interface for linux-based machines (scripts can be written on [different languages](https://grpc.io/docs/)) and devices Arduino, ATtiny, ATmega, ESP8266, etc.

### Components
**PJONâ„¢** (Padded Jittering Operative Network) is an Arduino compatible, multi-master, multi-media communications bus system created and mantained by Giovanni Blu Mitolo gioscarab@gmail.com https://github.com/gioblu/PJON

**gRPC** is a modern open source high performance RPC framework that can run in any environment https://github.com/grpc/grpc

### Server features
- Receive requests from application located on RPi/PC (via gRPC, for example [pjon_grpc_client.py](examples/clients/python/pjon_grpc_client.py)) and send back responses from devices (like Arduino) connected with RPi through PJON [ThroughSerialAsync](https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies/ThroughSerialAsync) strategy.
- Receive and forward messages to application located on RPi/PC from devices through PJON [ThroughSerialAsync](https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master/src/strategies/ThroughSerialAsync) strategy (via gRPC, for example [pjon_grpc_clientserver.py](examples/clients/python/pjon_grpc_clientserver.py))
- Communication between RPi/PC and devices (like Arduino) through any [PJON strategies](https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/blob/master/documentation/configuration.md) via [router](examples/devices/router_extender)
- Can be configured for working with 2 modules at the same time (see [pjon-grpc.cfg](server/conf/pjon-grpc.cfg)). Logic isolated in separate threads for maximum performance. Very useful if need to distribute the load, for example, `1st module` can be configured for accept and response on requests, `2nd module` can be configured for accept only incoming messages.

**Required** PJON version >[11.1](https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/11.1)

**Tested** and fully compatible with [master branch](https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/tree/master)
