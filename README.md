gRPC is a modern open source high performance RPC framework that can run in any environment https://github.com/grpc/grpc

### Features
- Receive requests from client application (via gRPC, for example [pjon_grpc_client.py](client/python/pjon_grpc_client.py)) and send back responses from devices connected with RPi through PJON SoftwareBitBang strategy.
- Receive and forward to client messages from devices through PJON SoftwareBitBang strategy (via gRPC, for example [pjon_grpc_clientserver.py](client/python/pjon_grpc_clientserver.py))
